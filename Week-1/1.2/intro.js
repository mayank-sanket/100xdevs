// week 1.2 class

console.log("hello world")
// console.log(a) // gives error as a is not defined

// in this case the code partially ran  (till line 3) | you can't do this in compiled languages such as C++
// JS is an interpreted lang and it can partially run in case of errors

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Strict vs Dynamic Languages
// benefits of strict lang : more strict code 
// benefit of dynamic lang: can move fast

/*
int a = 5;
a = "hello";  // compile time error
cout<<a<<endl;

-- this code will give a compile-time error in CPP

let a = 12;
a = "hello";
console.log(a); //  prints "hello"

-- no error in JavaScript

-- JS is loosely typed language
-- how to ensure type safety? use TypeScript

// ----------------------------------------------------------------

// Single Threaded Nature of JS
// context switching between processes in the CPU

// since JS is single threaded, it occupies only one thread
//line by line execution

// languages such as Java, Golang etc, which are multithreaded, let you use multiple threads at the same time to reduce time consumption

// due to single threaded nature of JS, it is considered a bad language for scalable systems

// Yes, there is a way to make it use all the cores of your machine -- advanced
