## You need to create 4 routes (4 things the hospital can do)

1. GET - User can check how many kidneys they have and their health status
2. POST - User can add a new kidney (a healthy one by default)
3. PUT - User can replace a kidney, make it healthy
4. DELETE - User can remove a kidney


## what should happen if: 1hr: 03min
1. they try to delete when there are no unhealthy kidneys?
2. they try to make a kidney healthy when all are already healthy?

## take a look into the put and the delete requests again after some time to ensure they are written correctly with proper functionality
